PROJECT DESCRIPTION

(a) Truncated power series: f(t)=1+t/2−t2/3,fromt=0tot=6s. Make the line thickness equal to “3”.

(b) Shifted sinusoid: g(x)= 4⋅cos(3⋅(x −2)), from x = –5m to x = 5m, using a red line. Change the vertical axis limits to be –6 to 6.

(c) Normalized Gaussian: Plot the probability density function shown to the right, from x = 0m to x = 10m, P(x)= with a dotted line. Make the title 24pt, the axis labels
20pt, and the axis values 16pt. Adjust the size of the
window so that these fonts sizes are appropriate.
Note that the units of P(x) are inverse meters (m^–1).

(d) Three dampings for parallel RLC:
Consider the three voltage functions shown to the right where t is in seconds and v is in volts. Plot all three on one pair of axes, from t = 0 to t = 40ms. Make them red, green, and blue. Add a legend. (The first is “overdamped”, the second is “critically damped”, 
and the third is “underdamped”.)
