PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Consider a circuit with a 10V source charging a 50mH inductor through a 2Ω resistor, after a switch closes at t = 0, as shown. A student in ECE 210 tells you that the current (in amps, A) as a function of time t is...

where V0 is the value of the source, R is the value of the resistor, and
t (tau) is the “time constant” L/R, which depends on the inductance L. From this (they say) we can then find the voltage across the inductor (in V), also as a function of time t...

And we can also find the power absorbed by the inductor (in W) as a function of time t...

Finally, with L in H and i in A, the total energy w stored in an inductor (in joules, J) at any time is...
