Consider the following ratio of two polynomials in x:

When functions of this form are inside an integral, it is impossible to evaluate the integral analytically without changing the form. With the method of partial fraction expansion, we can rewrite this ratio as a sum of simpler terms:

which puts the function into a form that can be used in the integral.

You will write a script to find the three coefficients, c1, c2, and c3. Then you will check your answer and study some peculiarities of the checking process. In particular, sometimes the check works and
sometimes it doesnâ€™t. It will be your job to find out why.
