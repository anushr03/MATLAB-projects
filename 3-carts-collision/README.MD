EXERCISE DESCRIPTION

Letâ€™s add one more cart, change the values here and there, and see what happens. As before, all collisions are elastic. (You may treat the diagram as a scale drawing.)

(a) After each collision, output an array of three velocities. How many collisions are there? 

(b) Show that both momentum and energy are both conserved after each collision.

(c) How do you know if there is another collision? Provide appropriate output.
